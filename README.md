# creating a ice cream shop using promises format

As a starter, this can be use for anything that required an array, an option to show the shop avaiability, and the production process.
As an example, I decided to create an ice cream shop. A problem I usually face is forgetting what the storage currently contain, and 
customers usually is fascinated knowing the process in which their foods (in this case their ice cream) is made. 

using promise format to create an ice cream shop. Use array as a database, option to show if shop is open or close, and production route.

This code does the following:
- apply array as a database to place data
- check the avaiability of the shop and send a response according to it (open or close)
- show the production step and route

using the async function to allows the code to run independently, and the await function help
to wait for a promise to settles and returns its result.
